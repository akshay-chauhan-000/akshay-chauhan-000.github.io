I am a **final-year PhD scholar in Computational Polymer Physics**, working at the intersection of soft matter physics, biophysics, and statistical mechanics. My research focuses on understanding how long-chain molecules such as polymers and biopolymers behave in complex, crowded environments that resemble conditions inside living cells.

Inside cells, macromolecules like DNA, RNA, and proteins exist in a dense and heterogeneous background of other macromolecules. This crowding fundamentally alters how polymers fold, move, self-assemble, and interact with interfaces. My work uses **coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations** to investigate how intrinsic polymer properties—such as topology (linear versus ring polymers), charge distribution, and flexibility—interact with environmental factors including macromolecular crowding, multivalent salts, and confinement.

A central theme of my research is the role of **polymer topology**. Ring polymers, which lack free ends, exhibit qualitatively different conformational and dynamical behavior compared to linear chains under identical conditions. Through simulations, I study how these topological differences influence polymer compaction, adsorption near surfaces, and anomalous transport. These investigations are motivated by biological systems such as bacterial chromosomes, plasmids, and chromatin organization.

Another major direction of my work concerns **salt-mediated self-assembly** in charged and amphiphilic polymers. I examine how multivalent ions regulate polymer aggregation, collapse, and re-expansion, including phenomena such as re-entrant condensation and the anti-polyelectrolyte effect. These studies are relevant to soft functional materials, polyelectrolyte systems, and biologically inspired assemblies.

More recently, I have explored **polymer transport and translocation** through nanopores and confined geometries under crowded conditions. By varying crowder size, geometry, and flexibility, I investigate how entropic barriers, depletion forces, and crowding anisotropy control transport pathways and timescales, with implications for both biological transport and synthetic nanopore technologies.

Methodologically, I work primarily with **coarse-grained bead–spring polymer models**, implemented using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. My research is grounded in statistical physics and numerical modeling, and I am increasingly interested in incorporating **machine learning and data-driven approaches** to analyze simulation data and construct reduced models of complex polymer systems.

## Outside Academia

Outside research, I enjoy **pencil drawing and shading**, which I find complements scientific thinking by encouraging observation and patience. I am an avid reader with interests spanning fiction, non-fiction, and scientific writing. I also maintain a regular **gym and fitness routine**, which helps me stay disciplined and focused alongside academic work.
